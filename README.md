***README for LLMAPI10.py
Same as for LLMAPI6.py but there are additional features as under:
On the sidebar,LLM will be quite useful for searching information not found otherwise in the app.The following links can be used to navigate.
*1.Reaction Database
*2.Compound Explorer
*3.Quick Tools ---a.Compound lookup, b.Select compound category, c.Functional group detector ,D.Smiles validator.
***In the Main function.there are 3 tabs--1.Browse by category,2.Search compounds,3.Advanced analysis.
